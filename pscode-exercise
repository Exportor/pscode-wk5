// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

	1. Request Input/Number - Prompt Box/Form
	2. % by 2
	3. Determine if Whole # or not.
	4. "If" Whole=Even
	5. "Else" Not=Odd

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

	1. Insert 5 forms/ Numbers request.
	2. Calculate Average Algorithm - Store Average in Variable
	3. Compare all 5 numbers to each other
	   to detemine smallest and largest i.e if #1 > #2		if #5 < #1
						elseif #1 > #3		...
						elseif #1 > #4
						elseif #1 > #5
						Print #1 Largest #
	Print result Average Algorithm "Average = #"
	Print result Largest/Smallest w labels Largest Smallest
